As a user, I should be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.

As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so
that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.

As a user, I should be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I
viewed the last time I was online.

As a user, I should be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can
open the app faster.

As a user, I should be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so
that I know what events are organized in which city.

This app will allow users to filter events, see number of events, and the details thereof in their city; it will also allow the user to change their city if they so desire. This app should also be accessible when offline.

As a developer, I plan to use serverless development to enable me to easily deploy my app without having to worry about building a server for deployment. My app will also make using of the automated scaling that comes with serverless, increasing the responsiveness and cost efficiency of my app.
